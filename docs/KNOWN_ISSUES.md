# Known Issues

## Non-standard layout/constexpr acceptance gaps tracked as compatibility tests
These tests are intentionally kept in compatibility form so the current FlashCpp
suite stays green, even though they are not strictly standard-conforming under a
pedantic C++20 compiler.

- `tests/test_constexpr_offsetof_nested_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_constexpr_offsetof_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_identifier_binding_constexpr_function_call_member_access_prefers_static_member_function_ret42.cpp`
- `tests/test_infer_expr_type_expansion_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_no_unique_address_empty_member_same_type_overlap_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_outofline_nested_pack_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_outofline_nested_union_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_sizeof_offsetof.cpp`

## Constexpr evaluation does not yet expose standard semantic outcomes
The constant-expression pipeline still reports most unsuccessful evaluations as
one generic evaluator failure. It does not consistently distinguish these C++20
outcomes:

- the expression is still dependent and must be checked after substitution;
- substitution produced an ill-formed expression that requires a diagnostic;
- the expression is well-formed but is not a constant expression;
- the expression is a valid constant expression that the evaluator does not yet
  implement.

Template static-member normalization therefore still has phase-specific recovery.
`tryEarlyNormalizeTemplateStaticMemberInitializer(...)` returns no normalized
initializer for a generic evaluation failure, while `UnresolvedSizeofPolicy`
only makes unresolved/incomplete `sizeof(type-id)` a hard error during the final
retry for `constexpr` static members. C++20 validity is not determined by that
declaration flag or retry phase: a non-dependent invalid `sizeof` operand is
ill-formed whenever the specialization requires it.

The compatibility boundary is exercised by dependent NTTPs, recursive static
members, hidden-friend calls, and nested constexpr member/helper access, including:

- `tests/test_function_template_dependent_identifier_nttp_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_template_recursive_static_constexpr_member_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_template_static_constexpr_dependent_hidden_friend_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_template_static_member_initializer_helper_member_access_ret42.cpp`
- `tests/test_template_static_member_initializer_nested_constexpr_member_call_ret42.cpp`
- `tests/test_template_static_member_initializer_nested_helper_access_ret42.cpp`

These tests pass through the current staged replay/substitution/evaluation
pipeline, but a blanket conversion of every unsuccessful early evaluation into a
diagnostic regresses them. The long-term fix is a structured evaluation result,
standard point-of-instantiation checking for dependent expressions, and complete
constexpr call/member-access evaluation. Invalid semantic states should then
produce `CompileError`; missing canonical compiler metadata should produce
`InternalError`; unsupported evaluator coverage must not be accepted as either a
constant value or an ill-formed program.

## SysV single-eightbyte and x87 aggregate return gaps

Concrete SysV aggregate returns now plan `direct` vs `indirect` from canonical
layout classification during IR generation. Aggregates larger than two
eightbytes, and ≤16-byte MEMORY-class values such as unaligned packed
aggregates, select a hidden return slot. Incomplete or placeholder return types
are `dependent` and must not be treated as direct; concrete function/call IR
requires a resolved plan and surfaces missing canonical metadata as
`InternalError`.

Remaining gaps:

Single-eightbyte aggregate lowering still uses the legacy scalar path, which is
correct for INTEGER-class values but does not yet select an SSE register for
aggregates containing only `float`/`double`. Enabling strict classification for
that path currently exposes several IR producers that omit canonical type
identity for small class values. Those producers must be closed before the
scalar path is replaced; accepting an absent `TypeIndex` as INTEGER would only
preserve the same non-standard guess.

Aggregate returns containing `long double` also remain on the legacy path. Their
SysV result classification uses the X87/X87UP classes, which the current backend
return-register abstraction cannot represent yet. Aggregate parameters containing
`long double` are still classified as MEMORY as required.
