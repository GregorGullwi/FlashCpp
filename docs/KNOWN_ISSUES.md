# Known Issues

## Non-standard layout/constexpr acceptance gaps tracked as compatibility tests
These tests are intentionally kept in compatibility form so the current FlashCpp
suite stays green, even though they are not strictly standard-conforming under a
pedantic C++20 compiler.

- `tests/test_constexpr_offsetof_nested_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_constexpr_offsetof_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_identifier_binding_constexpr_function_call_member_access_prefers_static_member_function_ret42.cpp`
- `tests/test_infer_expr_type_expansion_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_no_unique_address_empty_member_same_type_overlap_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_outofline_nested_pack_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_outofline_nested_union_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_sizeof_offsetof.cpp`

## Constexpr evaluation does not yet expose standard semantic outcomes
The constant-expression pipeline still reports most unsuccessful evaluations as
one generic evaluator failure. It does not consistently distinguish these C++20
outcomes:

- the expression is still dependent and must be checked after substitution;
- substitution produced an ill-formed expression that requires a diagnostic;
- the expression is well-formed but is not a constant expression;
- the expression is a valid constant expression that the evaluator does not yet
  implement.

Template static-member normalization therefore still has phase-specific recovery.
`tryEarlyNormalizeTemplateStaticMemberInitializer(...)` returns no normalized
initializer for a generic evaluation failure, while `UnresolvedSizeofPolicy`
only makes unresolved/incomplete `sizeof(type-id)` a hard error during the final
retry for `constexpr` static members. C++20 validity is not determined by that
declaration flag or retry phase: a non-dependent invalid `sizeof` operand is
ill-formed whenever the specialization requires it.

The compatibility boundary is exercised by dependent NTTPs, recursive static
members, hidden-friend calls, and nested constexpr member/helper access, including:

- `tests/test_function_template_dependent_identifier_nttp_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_template_recursive_static_constexpr_member_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_template_static_constexpr_dependent_hidden_friend_ret0.cpp`
- `tests/test_template_static_member_initializer_helper_member_access_ret42.cpp`
- `tests/test_template_static_member_initializer_nested_constexpr_member_call_ret42.cpp`
- `tests/test_template_static_member_initializer_nested_helper_access_ret42.cpp`

These tests pass through the current staged replay/substitution/evaluation
pipeline, but a blanket conversion of every unsuccessful early evaluation into a
diagnostic regresses them. The long-term fix is a structured evaluation result,
standard point-of-instantiation checking for dependent expressions, and complete
constexpr call/member-access evaluation. Invalid semantic states should then
produce `CompileError`; missing canonical compiler metadata should produce
`InternalError`; unsupported evaluator coverage must not be accepted as either a
constant value or an ill-formed program.

## SysV x87 aggregate return gap

Concrete SysV aggregate returns plan `direct` vs `indirect` from canonical layout
classification during IR generation, including single-eightbyte SSE-only values
such as `struct { float; }` / `struct { double; }` that must use XMM0 rather than
the legacy integer return path. Aggregates larger than two eightbytes, and ≤16-byte
MEMORY-class values such as unaligned packed aggregates, select a hidden return
slot. Incomplete or placeholder return types are `dependent` and must not be
treated as direct; concrete function/call IR requires a resolved plan and surfaces
missing canonical metadata as `InternalError`.

Aggregate returns containing `long double` remain on the legacy path. Their SysV
result classification uses the X87/X87UP classes (`%st0` / paired X87UP), which the
current backend return-register abstraction cannot represent yet. Aggregate
parameters containing `long double` are still classified as MEMORY as required.

This gap is specific to `long double` (not `float`/`double` SSE aggregates). Closing
it is blocked on broader `long double` codegen support: FlashCpp currently has type
identity, some constexpr/overload/builtin coverage, and inconsistent sizing (80-bit
x87 extended in places, Windows-style 8-byte `double` alias elsewhere), but no real
x87 load/store/`%st0` emission path. Constexpr evaluation often collapses
`long double` to `double`. Do not paper over return ABI with size guesses or INTEGER
fallbacks; wait until `long double` lowering can emit the SysV x87 convention.
