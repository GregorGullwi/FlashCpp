# Template Argument Architecture Audit

**Date:** 2026-05-12  
**Last updated:** 2026-06-11

This document is a planning aid for the remaining template-infrastructure work.
It should describe the current architectural baseline, the highest-value
remaining gaps, and the next tasks to execute. It is intentionally not a
chronological work log.

## Current architectural baseline

The template system is now substantially more sema-owned than parser-owned in
the areas that were previously blocking standards-visible behavior:

- covered non-dependent template-body lookup preserves definition-context
  binding
- dependent alias resolution is semantic-only; the old textual
  `base::member` reconstruction path is gone
- replay/materialization paths are increasingly source-identity-driven instead
  of shape-driven
- normalized template/member direct-call resolution uses sema-owned
  overload-resolution argument typing rather than parser-owned argument typing
- semantic receiver-sensitive lookup for ordinary member calls, `operator[]`,
  and callable `operator()` now shares the same const-aware candidate
  partitioning model
- parser-selected direct/member-call targets are no longer trusted early once
  sema has enough typed evidence to decide or reject the call
- direct-call viability now requires real conversion paths instead of accepting
  parser-only optimistic struct-to-scalar matches
- function-pointer/function-reference call typing preserves the callee return
  type during overload ranking
- replay attachment in the covered out-of-line member and constructor paths now
  expects positive identity/signature evidence rather than silently accepting
  unresolved shape-based matches
- resolved direct-call materialization now preserves
  `DependentUnqualifiedCallLookupRecord` both when the instantiated target
  stays definition-bound and when dependent-unqualified POI completion selects
  a different final function, so sema/constexpr can reuse structured call
  metadata instead of re-running parser lookup or relying on mangled-name
  recovery in those paths
- the final parser-selected non-receiver direct-call fallback in
  `resolveCallArgAnnotationTarget(...)` is gone; ordinary direct calls now
  resolve through preserved semantic metadata, typed lookup, or explicit
  unresolved terminals instead of reusing the parser-selected target late
- primary-template out-of-line constructor replay now synchronizes the
  `StructTypeInfo` constructor copy through preserved source-member identity
  when that identity is already known, instead of always rescanning
  `StructTypeInfo` constructors afterward

## Architectural invariants to preserve

Follow-up work in this area should preserve these rules:

- preserve semantic identity end-to-end; do not rebuild meaning from text if a
  structured record can be carried instead
- prefer replay-first attachment using source identity plus canonical
  substituted-signature evidence
- treat parser-selected compatibility paths as temporary debt, not as a normal
  resolution mechanism
- when sema has enough typed evidence to decide, reject broad parser/codegen
  fallback instead of letting it continue
- if a path still lacks enough metadata, narrow the compatibility surface and
  document the gap explicitly

## Highest-value remaining architectural gaps

### 1. Residual replay/`StructTypeInfo` sync gaps

The broad signature-equivalent sync fallback is gone from the currently-covered
paths, but future failures in replay-heavy areas will likely still come from
metadata loss between source declarations and instantiated `StructTypeInfo`
copies.

Desired end state:

- every replay/sync path preserves source-member identity directly
- `StructTypeInfo` repair scans are not used to rediscover targets by name or
  arity when identity could have been preserved

Near-term remaining scope:

- in-loop member-function / constructor registration inside
  `Parser::try_instantiate_class_template()` is now unified locally, so the
  next cleanup target in this area is the remaining out-of-line replay/sync
  helper duplication rather than more registration drift
- remaining member-template and constructor-template `StructTypeInfo` sync
  sites still recover through replay-source-key helper scans after the source
  declaration is already known

### 2. Remaining direct-call metadata loss outside dependent-unqualified completion

Dependent-unqualified direct-call completion now preserves both the
definition-bound ordinary lookup and the final point-of-instantiation target
through resolved-call materialization, and the final parser-selected
non-receiver fallback is gone. The remaining direct-call metadata risk is
therefore narrower: other instantiated ordinary direct-call paths may still
reach sema with only mangled compatibility evidence instead of preserved
structured lookup metadata.

Desired end state:

- every instantiated ordinary direct call preserves enough structured semantic
  evidence to recover its final target directly
- sema does not need mangled-name recovery to reuse a completed
  replay/materialization result

### 3. Current-instantiation / unknown-specialization precision

This is no longer the first task, but it remains the next structural lever once
the replay-identity gaps above are smaller. Expand it only where it unblocks
real replay or typed-lookup failures.

## Recommended task order

1. Fix the next member-template or constructor-template `StructTypeInfo` sync
   miss by preserving source identity in that path instead of recovering the
   copy through a helper scan.

2. Tighten the next remaining mangled-name compatibility path by preserving
   structured direct-call metadata in the owning replay/materialization path
   instead of relying on mangled recovery.

3. Only after steps 1-2 are stable, expand
   current-instantiation/unknown-specialization modeling for the concrete cases
   that still block standards-conforming typed lookup.

## Validation guidance

When changing this area, always rerun:

- the focused regression that motivated the slice
- `template_lookup_non_dependent_no_rebind_ret0.cpp`
- `test_template_dependent_unqualified_mangled_recovery_ret0.cpp`
- `test_template_dependent_unqualified_member_replay_ret0.cpp`
- `test_template_dependent_unqualified_poi_adl_record_ret42.cpp`
- `test_template_qualified_direct_call_inner_return_overload_ret0.cpp`
- `test_template_dependent_unqualified_direct_call_nonviable_fail.cpp`
- `test_operator_subscript_sema_receiver_and_arg_overload_ret0.cpp`
- `test_operator_subscript_const_ambiguity_fail.cpp`
- `test_constexpr_operator_bracket_const_nonconst_ret0.cpp`
- `test_subscript_pointer_conversion_template_ret42.cpp`
- full `pwsh tests/run_all_tests.ps1` before closing the slice
