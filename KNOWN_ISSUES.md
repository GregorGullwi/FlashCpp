# Known Issues — FlashCpp

This file records confirmed bugs and quality-of-implementation (QoI) deficiencies in the
FlashCpp C++20 compiler. Each entry includes the root cause, the affected code path, and
(where applicable) a recommended fix. Resolved issues should be removed rather than kept
as a stale history log.

## 1) `std::_Optional_payload` / `std::_Tuple_impl` — type size 0 in IR codegen (OPEN)

- **Symptom**: `IR conversion failed for node 'move': Type with no runtime size reached
  codegen in reference identifier lvalue lowering (type=28, ...)` when compiling
  `<optional>` and `<tuple>`.
- **Root cause**: `type=28` is a struct/class type whose size was not computed before
  codegen. The payload/impl types are recursive union variants whose sizeof is not
  resolved during template instantiation.
- **Impact**: `test_std_optional`, `test_std_tuple` fail.

## 2) Standard-library template-instantiation noise during `<ratio>` compile

- **Symptom**: compiling `tests/std/test_std_ratio.cpp` now emits
  `[ERROR][Templates] [depth=1]: All 2 template overload(s) failed for 'swap'`,
  the same error for `std::swap`, and
  `[ERROR][Templates] [depth=1]: All 1 template overload(s) failed for '_Hash_representation'`
  before the later IR-conversion failure.
- **Root cause**: still under investigation. These diagnostics appear during
  standard-header template processing after the earlier dependent member-template
  parse failure was fixed, but they are not the first fatal stop in the
  compilation.
- **Impact**: Diagnostic noise only; not a correctness failure in isolation.
